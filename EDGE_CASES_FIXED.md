## 🏆 Final Results

```
 Test Files  6 passed (6)
      Tests  161 passed (161)  ← 100%! 🎉
   Duration  954ms

**Previous**: 157/161 (97.5%)  
**Current**: 161/161 (100%) ✅  
**Fixed**: 4 edge cases in ~25 minutes

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. **Implication - lawResults Population** ✅
**Issue**: `lawResults.get()` returning undefined - results not being stored

**Fix**: Added `results.set()` calls for both antecedent and consequent

**Result**: Implication now properly tracks both law executions in lawResults map

---

### 2. **Sequence - Input Threading** ✅
**Issue**: Pipeline returning NaN instead of 27 - value threading broken

**Fix**: Properly thread output as input using `currentInputs = [lawResult.value as any]`

**Result**: Sequence pipeline now correctly threads: (10 + 5) * 2 - 3 = 27

---

### 3. **Nested Meta-Laws** ✅
**Issue**: Deep nesting returning NaN due to conflict detection

**Fix**: Skip conflict detection for implication and sequence compositions (values are EXPECTED to differ in these modes)

**Result**: Nested meta-laws work: ((10 + 1) * 2) - 5 = 17

---

### 4. **Error Resolution - Throw on Conflict** ✅
**Issue**: Error not being thrown synchronously - caught by try/catch

**Fix**: Re-throw conflicts detected errors in catch block so they propagate to caller

**Result**: Error resolution strategy now properly throws when conflicts detected

## 🎯 Key Insights

### 1. **Composition-Aware Conflict Detection**
Different composition operators have different expectations:
- **Conjunction/Disjunction**: Values SHOULD match → check for conflicts
- **Implication/Sequence**: Values EXPECTED to differ → skip conflict detection
- **Parallel**: Values can differ → optional conflict checking

### 2. **Error Handling Strategy**
When `conflictResolution: 'error'`:
- Detect conflicts after execution
- Throw error synchronously
- Re-throw in catch block to propagate to caller
- Don't wrap in `{ success: false, error: ... }` response

### 3. **Result Map Population**
Every composition operator must populate `results` Map:
- Enables conflict detection
- Provides execution history
- Supports debugging and inspection

### 4. **Input Threading in Sequence**
Sequence composition requires careful value threading:
- Store output from each law
- Pass as input to next law
- Handle type conversions carefully
- Thread `[value]` not just `value`
