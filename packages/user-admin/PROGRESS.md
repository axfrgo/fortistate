- Activity feed now records "organization_created" and "user_logged_in" entries
- Logout/login loop verified continues to append login activity without breaking the session

### **Artifacts Updated**
- `src/app/api/dashboard/route.ts` (data orchestration)
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (client UI + fetch lifecycle)

   - Should show welcome message with your name
   - Should show organization name in sidebar
   - Should show real stats (1 team member initially)
   - Should show empty activity feed

3. **Logout:**
   - Click "Sign Out" in sidebar
   - Should redirect to login page

4. **Login:**
