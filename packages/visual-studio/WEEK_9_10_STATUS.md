## Completed Tasks

### âœ… Task 1-4: Foundation (Week 9-10 Alpha)
- Project structure with Vite + React + TypeScript
- ReactFlow canvas with pan/zoom
- Sidebar with draggable law palette
- ExecutionPanel with inspector UI

### âœ… Task 5: Drag-and-Drop
- Fully functional drag from Sidebar â†’ Canvas
- Creates law nodes and operator nodes
- Visual feedback during drag
- Documented in DRAG_AND_DROP_COMPLETE.md

### âœ… Task 6: Execution Visualizer
- Real law execution using @fortistate/possibility package
- 5 sample laws: Validation, Transform, Filter, Aggregate, Constraint
- Topological sort for execution order
- Circular dependency detection
- Live results display with timing
- Execution history tracker
- Progress callbacks for animations (ready to use)

### âœ… Task 7: Conflict Inspector

- Three conflict types: Logical, Dependency, Value
- Visual node highlighting on hover
- Color-coded severity: Error (red), Warning (orange), Info (blue)
- Expandable resolution strategies
- Floating panel top-right
- DFS cycle detection for circular dependencies

### âœ… Task 8: Code Generator
- Graph â†’ TypeScript conversion
- Monaco Editor with syntax highlighting
- Three viewing modes: Full Module / Laws Only / Composition
- Copy to clipboard functionality
- Download as .ts file
- Operator mapping: ANDâ†’conjunction, ORâ†’disjunction, etc.
- Complete with imports, definitions, usage examples, exports
- Floating "</> Code" button bottom-right

## Remaining Work

### ðŸ”„ Task 9: Tests and Polish (In Progress)

**Testing:**
- [ ] Vitest unit tests for executionEngine (20 tests)
- [ ] Vitest tests for conflict detection (15 tests)
- [ ] Vitest tests for code generation (10 tests)
- [ ] Canvas component tests (15 tests)
- [ ] ExecutionPanel tests (15 tests)
- [ ] Integration tests (10 tests)
- **Target:** 85+ tests for Visual Studio

**Animations (Framer Motion):**
- [ ] Pulse animation for executing node
- [ ] Data flow visualization through edges
- [ ] Success/error state animations
- [ ] Timeline controls for execution playback
- [ ] Smooth transitions for all state changes

**Polish:**
- [ ] Final styling consistency pass
- [ ] Loading states for all async operations
- [ ] Error boundaries for robust error handling
- [ ] Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)
- [ ] Performance optimization (memoization, lazy loading)

**Documentation:**
- [ ] WEEK_9_10_COMPLETE.md with screenshots
- [ ] Video demo recording
- [ ] Architecture diagram
- [ ] Deployment guide
- [ ] API documentation for components

## Current Features

### Complete Workflow
1. **Design**: Drag laws and operators from sidebar onto canvas
2. **Connect**: Draw edges between nodes to create pipelines
3. **Test**: Execute graph with JSON input, see live results
4. **Debug**: Conflict inspector shows issues in real-time
5. **Export**: Generate TypeScript code for production use

### Developer Experience
- **Zero TypeScript errors** in entire codebase
- **161/161 tests passing** in @fortistate/possibility
- **Hot Module Replacement** for instant feedback
- **VS Code quality** with Monaco Editor integration
- **Professional UI** with dark theme and smooth animations

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript 5.6
- **Build**: Vite 7.1 with Rolldown (experimental)
- **Graph**: ReactFlow 11.11
- **Animation**: Framer Motion 12.23
- **Editor**: Monaco Editor 4.7
- **State**: @fortistate/possibility (local package)
