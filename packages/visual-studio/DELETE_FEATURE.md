# 🗑️ Delete Functionality Guide

## Overview
The Visual Studio now supports **full keyboard-based deletion** of nodes and edges on the canvas.

---

## 🎯 How to Delete

### **Delete Nodes**
1. Click on a node to select it (purple border appears)
2. Press `Delete` or `Backspace` key
3. Node is removed along with all connected edges

### **Delete Edges**
1. Click on an edge to select it (pink color appears)
2. Press `Delete` or `Backspace` key
3. Edge is removed

### **Multi-Delete**
1. Select multiple nodes/edges (Shift+Click or drag-select)
2. Press `Delete` or `Backspace` key
3. All selected elements removed at once

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Canvas Component**
Added keyboard event handler:
```typescript
const onKeyDown = useCallback((event: React.KeyboardEvent) => {
  if (event.key === 'Delete' || event.key === 'Backspace') {
    // Get selected nodes and edges
    const selectedNodes = getNodes().filter(node => node.selected)
    const selectedEdges = getEdges().filter(edge => edge.selected)
    
    // Delete nodes and connected edges
    if (selectedNodes.length > 0) {
      const nodeIds = selectedNodes.map(n => n.id)
      setNodes(nds => nds.filter(n => !nodeIds.includes(n.id)))
      setEdges(eds => eds.filter(e => 
        !nodeIds.includes(e.source) && !nodeIds.includes(e.target)
      ))
      onNodeSelect(null) // Clear selection
    }
    
    // Delete edges
    if (selectedEdges.length > 0) {
      const edgeIds = selectedEdges.map(e => e.id)
      setEdges(eds => eds.filter(e => !edgeIds.includes(e.id)))
    }
  }
}, [getNodes, getEdges, setNodes, setEdges, onNodeSelect])
```

### **Canvas Wrapper**
Made the canvas focusable:
```tsx
<div 
  ref={reactFlowWrapper}
  className="canvas"
  onKeyDown={onKeyDown}
  tabIndex={0} // Makes it keyboard-focusable
>
```

### **ReactFlow Integration**
Added built-in delete support:
```tsx
<ReactFlow
  deleteKeyCode={['Delete', 'Backspace']}
  // ... other props
>
```

## ✨ Features

### **Smart Edge Cleanup**
When you delete a node, all edges connected to it are **automatically removed**:
```typescript
setEdges(eds => eds.filter(e => 
  !nodeIds.includes(e.source) && !nodeIds.includes(e.target)
))
```

### **Selection Management**
After deletion, the selection is cleared:
```typescript
onNodeSelect(null)
```

### **Multi-Select Support**
Works with ReactFlow's built-in multi-select:
- Shift+Click: Add to selection
- Drag box: Select multiple
- Delete all selected at once

## 🎮 Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Delete` | Delete selected elements |
| `Backspace` | Delete selected elements (alternative) |
| `Shift+Click` | Multi-select nodes/edges |
| `Click` | Select single element |
| `Esc` | Deselect all (ReactFlow default) |

## 🔍 Visual Feedback

### **Selected Node**
- Purple border appears
- Subtle glow effect
- Transform: `translateY(-2px)`

### **Selected Edge**
- Color changes to pink
- Stroke width increases
- Glow effect

### **Hover State**
- Node lifts up
- Border color intensifies
- Shadow increases

---

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test Cases**
✅ Delete single node
✅ Delete multiple nodes
✅ Delete single edge
✅ Delete multiple edges
✅ Edges auto-remove when node deleted
✅ Selection clears after delete
✅ Works with both Delete and Backspace
✅ Canvas remains focusable after delete

### **Edge Cases**
✅ Delete with no selection (no action)
✅ Delete all nodes (canvas becomes empty)
✅ Delete node with many edges (all edges removed)
✅ Keyboard focus maintained

---

## 💡 Usage Tips

### **Best Practices**
1. **Click canvas first** to ensure keyboard focus
2. **Use Shift+Click** for precise multi-select
3. **Drag-select** for bulk operations
4. **Double-check** before deleting (no undo yet)

### **Workflow**
```
1. Design your law graph
2. Test execution
3. Delete unwanted nodes/edges
4. Refine and iterate
```
