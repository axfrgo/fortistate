# âš¡ Active Edge Visualization

## Overview
The Visual Studio now provides **real-time visual feedback** showing which connections are actively passing data during law execution!

---

## âœ¨ What You'll See

### **Normal Edges** (Idle State)
- Purple gradient (blue â†’ purple â†’ pink)
- Subtle glow effect
- Standard 2.5px width

### **Active Edges** (Data Flowing) ðŸ”¥
When a law executes and passes data to the next law, the connection:
- âš¡ **Pulses with bright glow** - Breathes between 8px and 16px glow
- ðŸŒˆ **Animated gradient** - Colors shift dynamically
- ðŸ“Š **Thicker stroke** - 3.5px width for emphasis
- âœ¨ **Dash animation** - Moving dashed pattern
- ðŸ’« **Enhanced visibility** - Impossible to miss!

---

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

### **Technical Logic**
An edge becomes "active" when:
1. **Source node executed successfully** AND target node is currently executing
2. OR **Source node is currently executing** (outgoing data)

```typescript
const sourceExecuted = executionResults?.has(edge.source) && 
                       executionResults.get(edge.source)?.success
const targetExecuting = currentExecutingNode === edge.target
const sourceExecuting = currentExecutingNode === edge.source

const isActive = (sourceExecuted && targetExecuting) || sourceExecuting
```

### **Visual Effects Applied**
```typescript
{
  animated: true,           // ReactFlow animated prop
  className: 'active-edge', // Custom CSS class
  style: {
    strokeWidth: 3.5        // Thicker line
  }
}
```

## ðŸŽ¨ CSS Animation

### **Pulse Effect**
```css
@keyframes pulse-edge {
  0%, 100% {
    filter: drop-shadow(0 0 8px rgba(102, 126, 234, 0.6));
  }
  50% {
    filter: drop-shadow(0 0 16px rgba(102, 126, 234, 1));
  }
}
```

### **Gradient Animation**
```svg
<linearGradient id="edge-gradient-active">
  <stop offset="0%" stopColor="#667eea">
    <animate attributeName="stop-color" 
      values="#667eea;#a78bfa;#667eea" 
      dur="2s" 
      repeatCount="indefinite" />
  </stop>
  <!-- More animated stops... -->
</linearGradient>
```

## ðŸŽ® See It In Action

### **Demo Workflow**
1. Drag **Validation Law** onto canvas
2. Drag **Transform Law** below it  
3. Connect validation â†’ transform (purple edge appears)
4. Click **"Execute Graph"**
5. Watch as the edge **lights up** when data flows! âš¡

### **Visual Sequence**
```
Time 0s:   Validation starts executing
           â†“ Edge is ACTIVE (source executing)
           
Time 0.3s: Validation completes âœ“
           â†“ Edge stays ACTIVE (source done, target starts)
           
Time 0.6s: Transform starts executing
           â†“ Edge pulses with bright glow
           
Time 0.9s: Transform completes âœ“
           â†“ Edge returns to normal
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Edge States Summary

| State | Visual | When |
|-------|--------|------|
| **Idle** | Purple gradient, subtle glow | Default state |
| **Hover** | Brighter glow | Mouse over edge |
| **Selected** | Pink gradient, strong glow | Clicked/selected |
| **Active** | Pulsing glow, animated gradient, thick | Data flowing through |

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Philosophy

> "Make data flow visible and beautiful"

The active edge visualization follows these principles:
1. **Obvious** - You can't miss when data is flowing
2. **Beautiful** - Premium animated gradients and glows
3. **Performant** - Smooth 60fps CSS animations
4. **Informative** - Clear indication of execution state

---

## ðŸš€ Impact

### **Before**
- No indication of active connections
- Hard to understand execution flow
- Static, lifeless edges

### **After**
- âš¡ Bright, pulsing active edges
- ðŸŽ¨ Animated gradients
- ðŸ’« Real-time data flow visualization
- ðŸŽ¯ Clear execution understanding

---

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

### **1. Watch The Flow**
During execution, follow the glowing edges to understand how data moves through your graph.

### **2. Debug Visually**
If an edge doesn't light up, the connection might not be executing as expected.

### **3. Understand Dependencies**
Active edges show you the exact execution order in real-time.

### **4. Performance Profiling**
Watch edge timing to identify slow connections.

- [ ] Edge labels showing data values
- [ ] Different colors for different data types
- [ ] Error state for failed connections
