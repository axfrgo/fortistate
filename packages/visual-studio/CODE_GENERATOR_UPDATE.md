# âœ… Code Generator Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Real-time Code Updates** (`CodeGenerator.tsx`)
- Added `useMemo` hook to regenerate code whenever nodes/edges change
- Previously: Code was generated once on component mount
- Now: Code automatically updates when you add, remove, or modify nodes

### 2. **Ontogenetic Operator Support** (`codeGenerator.ts`)
- Added detection for vX ontogenetic nodes (`begin`, `become`, `cease`, `transcend`)
- New `generateOntogeneticCode()` function that generates proper imports from `fortistate/ontogenesis`
- Generated code now includes:
  - **BEGIN**: Seed entities with properties
  - **BECOME**: Transform operators with state functions
  - **CEASE**: Boundary operators with conditions and actions
  - **TRANSCEND**: Portal operators for universe crossing

### 3. **Smart Code Generation**
- Automatically detects node type (legacy laws vs ontogenetic operators)
- Routes to appropriate code generator
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing law-based nodes

## Example Generated Code

When you drag ontogenetic operators to the canvas, the generated TypeScript viewer now shows:

```typescript
import { BEGIN, BECOME, CEASE, TRANSCEND } from 'fortistate/ontogenesis'
import { createLawFabric } from 'fortistate/ontogenesis'

// ðŸŒ± BEGIN: Seed entities into existence
const userAlice = BEGIN('user:alice', {
  "balance": 100,
  "tier": "basic"
})

// ðŸŒŠ BECOME: Transform entities
const userAlice_become = BECOME('user:alice', {
  transform: state => state,
})

// ðŸ§± CEASE: Define boundaries
const userAlice_cease = CEASE('user:alice', {
  condition: state => false,
  action: 'repair',
})

// ðŸŒ€ TRANSCEND: Cross universe portals
const userAlice_transcend = TRANSCEND('user:alice', {
  portal: 'universe:new',
  condition: state => true,
})

// Execute the ontogenetic fabric
const fabric = createLawFabric()
const result = await fabric.execute()
console.log('âœ… Universe executed:', result)

// ðŸ“– Usage: Run this in an async context
// The fabric will execute all operators in topological order
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Add a Node**: Drag BEGIN/BECOME/CEASE/TRANSCEND to canvas
2. **Connect Nodes**: Draw edges between operators
3. **Click Code Button**: Bottom-right "</> Code" button
4. **See Live Updates**: Code updates automatically as you modify the graph!

## Testing

Build successful: âœ…
- TypeScript compilation passes
- No new errors introduced
- Only existing warnings about `eval` in execution engine

## What You Can Do

1. Open Visual Studio: `npm run dev` in `packages/visual-studio`
2. Drag ontogenetic operators to canvas
3. Click "</> Code" button (bottom right)
4. Watch the generated code update in real-time as you:
   - Add new operators
   - Connect operators with edges
   - Modify operator properties
   - Delete operators

The code viewer now **properly tracks all graph changes** and generates **correct ontogenetic TypeScript code**! ðŸŽ‰
