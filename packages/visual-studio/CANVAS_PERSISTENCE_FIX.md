# 🎯 Canvas Persistence - Root Cause Fix

## Problem Identified

The diagnostic logs revealed the **exact issue**:

### What Was Happening:

1. ✅ User logs in → `startSession()` called
2. ✅ Data successfully restored from localStorage (4 nodes, 3 edges)
3. ✅ Session store updated with restored canvas state
4. ❌ **RACE CONDITION**: `persistCanvasState()` called immediately
5. ❌ At this point, `nodesRef.current` and `edgesRef.current` are **still empty** (0 nodes, 0 edges)
6. ❌ Empty canvas state **overwrites** the good restored data
7. ❌ Empty state saved to localStorage
8. ❌ Restoration effect runs → sees empty state → "No canvas content to restore"

### The Race Condition:

```
Timeline:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
t0: User logs in
t1: startSession() → Restored state written to sessionStore.workState
t2: Canvas component mounts → nodesRef/edgesRef = [] (empty)
t3: handleNodesChange() called → persistCanvasState() with empty refs
t4: Empty state overwrites workState in sessionStore
t5: Empty state written to localStorage (GOOD DATA LOST!)
t6: Restoration effect runs → tries to restore from workState → empty
```

### Why Empty Refs?

The Canvas component's internal React Flow state (`useNodesState`/`useEdgesState`) starts empty on mount. The restoration function updates React Flow's state, which then triggers `handleNodesChange`, but this happens **after** several other useEffect hooks have already fired and called `persistCanvasState()` with empty refs.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Restoration Lock Pattern

Added `isRestoringRef` to track when restoration is in progress:

```typescript
const isRestoringRef = useRef<boolean>(false)
```

### 2. Guard in `persistCanvasState()`

Skip saving during restoration:

```typescript
if (isRestoringRef.current) {
  console.log('⏸️ [DIAGNOSTIC] Skipping persist - restoration in progress')
  return
}

// Also skip if we're about to overwrite good data
if (nodesRef.current.length === 0 && workState.canvasState?.nodes && workState.canvasState.nodes.length > 0) {
  console.log('⏸️ [DIAGNOSTIC] Skipping persist - have restored data but refs not updated yet')
  return
}
```

### 3. Lock Acquisition/Release

In the restoration effect:

```typescript
const performRestore = () => {
  // Acquire lock
  isRestoringRef.current = true
  console.log('🔒 [DIAGNOSTIC] Restoration lock acquired')

  // Perform restoration
  restoreFn(nodesToRestore, edgesToRestore)
  nodesRef.current = nodesToRestore
  edgesRef.current = edgesToRestore
  
  // ... other restoration logic ...

  // Release lock after restoration completes
  setTimeout(() => {
    isRestoringRef.current = false
    console.log('🔓 [DIAGNOSTIC] Restoration lock released')
  }, 100)
}
```

## How It Works Now

### New Timeline:

```
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
t0: User logs in
t1: startSession() → Restored state written to sessionStore.workState
t2: Canvas component mounts → nodesRef/edgesRef = [] (empty)
t3: handleNodesChange() called → persistCanvasState() checks lock
    → isRestoringRef = false BUT workState has nodes and refs are empty
    → ⏸️ SKIPPED! (prevented overwrite)
t4: Restoration effect runs → acquires lock (isRestoringRef = true)
t5: restoreFn() updates React Flow state
t6: nodesRef/edgesRef updated with restored nodes
t7: handleNodesChange() called → persistCanvasState() checks lock
    → isRestoringRef = true
    → ⏸️ SKIPPED! (restoration in progress)
t8: Lock released after 100ms
t9: Future changes → persistCanvasState() runs normally
```

## Expected Diagnostic Output (Fixed)

When you sign in now, you should see:

```
🚀 [DIAGNOSTIC] startSession called
✅ [DIAGNOSTIC] Work state restored from localStorage
📊 [DIAGNOSTIC] Restored canvas nodes: 4

🔍 [DIAGNOSTIC] persistCanvasState called
📊 [DIAGNOSTIC] Current state - nodes: 0 edges: 0
⏸️ [DIAGNOSTIC] Skipping persist - have restored data but refs not updated yet

🔄 [DIAGNOSTIC] Restoration effect triggered
🔒 [DIAGNOSTIC] Restoration lock acquired
🎉 [DIAGNOSTIC] PERFORMING CANVAS RESTORATION
📊 [DIAGNOSTIC] Restoring canvas state: {nodes: 4, edges: 3}

🔍 [DIAGNOSTIC] persistCanvasState called
🔄 [DIAGNOSTIC] Is restoring: true
⏸️ [DIAGNOSTIC] Skipping persist - restoration in progress

🔓 [DIAGNOSTIC] Restoration lock released
✅ [DIAGNOSTIC] Canvas restoration complete
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Fresh Sign-In With Saved Data

1. **Clear localStorage** (if you want a clean test)
2. **Load example** nodes (use "Load Example" button)
3. **Sign out**
4. **Sign back in**
5. **Expected result**: Nodes should reappear ✅

### Test 2: Add Nodes and Persist

1. **Sign in**
2. **Add 3-4 nodes** to canvas
3. **Click "💾 Save Canvas"** button
4. **Check console**: Should see save logs with correct node count
5. **Sign out**
6. **Sign back in**
7. **Expected result**: Your added nodes should reappear ✅

### Test 3: Verify No Overwrite

1. **Sign in** (with saved data)
2. **Check console logs** immediately
3. **Expected**: Should see "⏸️ Skipping persist" messages
4. **Expected**: Should see "🔒 Restoration lock acquired"
5. **Expected**: Canvas should show restored nodes

## What to Look For

### ✅ Good Signs:

- `⏸️ [DIAGNOSTIC] Skipping persist - restoration in progress`
- `⏸️ [DIAGNOSTIC] Skipping persist - have restored data but refs not updated yet`
- `🔒 [DIAGNOSTIC] Restoration lock acquired`
- `🔓 [DIAGNOSTIC] Restoration lock released`
- `🎉 [DIAGNOSTIC] PERFORMING CANVAS RESTORATION` with node count > 0
- Nodes appearing on canvas after sign-in

### ❌ Bad Signs:

- `⚠️ [DIAGNOSTIC] No canvas content to restore (empty state)` when you know you saved data
- `📊 [DIAGNOSTIC] Verification - canvas nodes in storage: 0` right after restoration
- Canvas empty after sign-in when it should have nodes

---

## Additional Protection

The guard also prevents empty-state overwrites in other scenarios:

1. **Component re-mounts** during navigation
2. **Hot module replacement** during development
3. **React Strict Mode** double-rendering
4. **Concurrent rendering** race conditions

---

## Summary

The canvas persistence system now has:

1. ✅ **Restoration lock** to prevent race conditions
2. ✅ **Smart guards** to prevent empty-state overwrites
3. ✅ **Comprehensive diagnostics** to track every step
4. ✅ **100ms delay** to ensure restoration completes
5. ✅ **Save button** for manual persistence
6. ✅ **Success notification** with visual feedback

**The root cause was identified and fixed!** 🎉

Build passed successfully - ready for testing!
