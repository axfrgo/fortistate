Contributing
============

Thanks for wanting to help! A few guidelines to keep contributions smooth:

- Open an issue to discuss larger changes before implementing.
- Keep API changes backward compatible when possible. Major breaking changes should be discussed and scheduled for a major-version bump.
- Write a test for new functionality and run the test suite before opening a PR.
- Use the existing code style. Run `npm run build` and `npm test` locally.
- For release PRs, include a short changelog entry under `PUBLISH.md`.

Maintainers will review PRs and merge when CI is green.
