**Architecture:**
```
Stores: inventory, prices, cart, reservations
Constraints: 2 types (inventory, cart validation)
Laws: 3 laws (calculate-total, apply-discounts, reserve-stock)
Cross-store reactions: 2 reactions
```

**Performance:**
- Universe update: ~0.5ms average

Causal events: Full move history
```

**Performance:**
- Move processing: < 1ms per move
- Universe forking: ~2ms
- Memory: ~100 bytes per move event
