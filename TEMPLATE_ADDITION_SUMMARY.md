# Social Media Automation Template - Quick Summary

**Status**: âœ… Complete  
**Date**: October 10, 2025

## What Was Added

### New Template: Social Media Automation Pipeline ðŸ“±

A complete automation workflow that handles the entire social media content lifecycle:

1. **Ask ChatGPT** â†’ Generate 7 posts for the week
2. **Schedule to Calendar** â†’ Add posts to calendar (Mon-Sun)
3. **Post Daily** â†’ Publish one post per day (loops 7 times)
4. **Send Completion Message** â†’ Notify user when week is complete
5. **Optional: Auto-restart** â†’ Begin next week's campaign

## Files Modified

### 1. `packages/visual-studio/src/templates.ts`

**Changes**:
- Added `'automation'` to category type union
- Added new template: `automation-social-media` with 6 nodes and 6 edges

**Template Nodes**:
- BEGIN: Campaign initialization
- BECOME: Generate posts via ChatGPT API
- BECOME: Schedule posts to calendar
- BECOME: Publish daily (self-looping node)
- CEASE: Send completion notification
- TRANSCEND: Start next week's campaign

**Key Features**:
- Self-referencing loop edge (orange dashed) for daily posting
- State tracking: postsGenerated, postsScheduled, postsPublished
- Status progression: initialized â†’ generating â†’ scheduled â†’ publishing â†’ completed

## How It Works

### Workflow Flow

```
ðŸŒ± BEGIN Campaign
    â†“
ðŸ¤– BECOME: ChatGPT generates 7 posts
    â†“
ðŸ“… BECOME: Schedule to calendar
    â†“
ðŸ“¤ BECOME: Publish daily âŸ² (Loop 7x)
    â†“
âœ… CEASE: Send "Content week completed!" message
    â†“
ðŸ”„ TRANSCEND: Start next week (optional)
```

### Visual Studio Integration

The template now appears in the **Templates** section of the left sidebar:

- **Icon**: ðŸ“±
- **Name**: Social Media Automation
- **Description**: Weekly content pipeline: ChatGPT â†’ Calendar â†’ Daily Posts â†’ Completion
- **Category**: Automation (new category)

### Usage

1. Open Visual Studio
2. Look in left sidebar under "ðŸ“š Templates"
3. Click the **ðŸ“± Social Media Automation** card
4. The complete workflow loads onto canvas
5. Customize nodes for your specific APIs and triggers
6. Execute to run the automation

## Entity Structure

```typescript
entity: 'campaign:weekly'

properties: {
  status: 'initialized' | 'generating' | 'scheduled' | 'publishing' | 'completed'
  postsGenerated: 0,      // Target: 7
  postsScheduled: 0,      // Target: 7
  postsPublished: 0,      // Increments 0â†’7
  currentDay: 0           // Day counter
}
```

## Integration Points

### Required APIs/Services

1. **OpenAI ChatGPT API** - Generate content
2. **Calendar API** - Schedule posts (Google Calendar, etc.)
3. **Social Media APIs** - Publish posts (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram)
4. **Notification Service** - Send completion message (Email, SMS, Push)
5. **Scheduler** - Daily trigger mechanism (Cron, Cloud Functions)

## Node Details

| Node | Operator | Purpose | Trigger/Condition |
|------|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Campaign Init | BEGIN | Start new campaign | Manual start |
| Generate Posts | BECOME | ChatGPT creates 7 posts | API call |
| Schedule Calendar | BECOME | Add to calendar | Posts ready |
| Publish Daily | BECOME | Post to social media | Daily trigger (24h) |
| Week Complete | CEASE | Notify user | postsPublished === 7 |
| Next Week | TRANSCEND | Start new campaign | status === 'completed' |

## Looping Mechanism

The **Publish Daily** node has a **self-referencing edge** (loops back to itself):
- Executes once per day
- Increments counters each time
- Loops 7 times total (once for each day)
- Breaks loop when `postsPublished === 7`
- Proceeds to completion notification

## Customization Examples

### Change Post Frequency
```typescript
// 14 posts over 2 weeks instead of 7 posts over 1 week
postsGenerated: 14
condition: 'postsPublished === 14'
```

### Multi-Platform Publishing
```typescript
// Publish to multiple platforms simultaneously
trigger: 'publish to Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook'
```

### Add Approval Step
```typescript
// Insert CEASE node between Schedule and Publish
condition: 'approved === false'
action: 'pause until approval'
```

## Benefits

### Time Savings
- **Manual effort**: ~2-3 hours/week planning and posting
- **With automation**: ~30 minutes/week reviewing generated content
- **Savings**: ~85% reduction in time spent

### Consistency
- Never miss a scheduled post
- Maintain regular posting cadence
- Professional content quality via AI

### Scalability
- Run multiple campaigns simultaneously
- Manage multiple brands/accounts
- Easy to replicate for new projects
