### 🔒 Security

- Session-based authentication

### 🚀 Migration from v1.x

**Basic stores remain compatible:**
```javascript
// v1.x - still works!
const store = createStore(0)
```

**New universe-based approach:**
```javascript
// v2.0 - recommended
const substrate = createSubstrate('app', new Map())
const universe = createUniverse({ id: 'app', substrate })
const store = universe.createStore('counter', 0)
```
