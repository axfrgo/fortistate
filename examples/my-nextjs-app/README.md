# Fortistate Comprehensive DemoThis is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).



This Next.js application demonstrates **all features** of Fortistate delivered across **Epics 1-5**, showcasing the transformation into a production-ready, collaborative state management platform.## Getting Started



## üéØ What This Demo ShowsFirst, run the development server:



### Epic 1-3: Authentication & Developer Experience```bash

- **Unified auth system** with `createRoleEnforcer`npm run dev

- **Role-based access control** (observer/editor/admin)# or

- **Session management** with create/list/revoke operationsyarn dev

- **JWT tokens** with TTL (time-to-live)# or

- **CLI integration** for session workflowspnpm dev

# or

### Epic 4: Audit Loggingbun dev

- **Log rotation** (size and age-based)```

- **Multiple export formats** (JSON, CSV, plain text)

- **Complete audit trail** of all admin actionsOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

- **Compliance-ready** logging system

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Epic 5: Multi-User Collaboration

- **Real-time presence tracking** of connected usersThis project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

- **WebSocket protocol** for live updates

- **Active store awareness** - see what others are viewing## Learn More

- **Cursor tracking** through state tree navigation

- **Automatic idle cleanup** after 5 minutesTo learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

## Deploy on Vercel

---

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd examples/my-nextjs-app
npm install
```

### 2. Build Fortistate (if not already built)

```bash
cd ../../
npm run build
cd examples/my-nextjs-app
```

### 3. Start the Inspector

In one terminal:

```bash
# From the fortistate root
npm run inspect

# Optional: specify a custom port
npm run inspect -- --port 5173

# Allow the Next.js app (port 3000) to talk to the inspector
npm run inspect -- --allow-origin http://localhost:3000

# Combine flags as needed (port + allow-origin, etc.)
```

By default the inspector listens on **http://localhost:4000**. If you override the port or need to allow multiple origins, pass the flags shown above so the browser can reach it.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The demo now proxies REST calls through `/api/fortistate`, so listing sessions or fetching audit logs works even when the inspector omits CORS headers. You'll still want `--allow-origin http://localhost:3000` to keep the Presence WebSocket happy.

### 4. Configure the Demo (if needed)

The demo reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_INSPECTOR_URL` from `.env.local`. We ship a default file pointing to `http://localhost:4000`. If you changed the inspector port, update the variable:

```bash
echo NEXT_PUBLIC_INSPECTOR_URL=http://localhost:5173 > .env.local
```

### 5. Run the Next.js App

In another terminal:

```bash
# From examples/my-nextjs-app
npm run dev
```

The app will start on `http://localhost:3000`

### 6. Open Both in Your Browser

- **Demo App**: http://localhost:3000
- **Inspector**: http://localhost:4000 (or your configured port)

## üß™ Testing Collaboration Features

### Multi-User Scenario

**Setup:**
1. Open **3 browser windows** side-by-side
2. In each window:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Navigate to **Sessions** tab
   - Create a session with different roles and labels:
     - Window 1: Admin named "Alice"
     - Window 2: Editor named "Bob"
     - Window 3: Observer named "Charlie"

**Test Presence:**
1. Go to **Presence** tab in all windows
2. Select different stores in each window
3. See all users appear in the connected users list
4. Watch real-time updates as users change stores
5. Close one window and see the user disappear

**Test State Sync:**
1. Go to **Stores** tab in Window 1 (Alice - Admin)
2. Increment the counter
3. Watch the counter update in Window 2 and 3
4. Add items to cart in Window 2 (Bob - Editor)
5. See cart update in all windows

**Test Audit:**
1. In Window 1 (Alice - Admin), go to **Audit** tab
2. Fetch audit logs
3. See all the actions from all sessions
4. Create/revoke sessions and watch entries appear

## üîß Configuration

### Inspector Port

Change the inspector port by updating `.env.local` (all demo components read from `NEXT_PUBLIC_INSPECTOR_URL` and the proxy forwards to that host):

```bash
echo NEXT_PUBLIC_INSPECTOR_URL=http://localhost:5173 > .env.local
```

No source changes are required‚Äî`SessionManager`, `PresenceViewer`, and `AuditLogViewer` all pick up the new value automatically.

### Environment Variables

Set these in your inspector environment:

```bash
# Session secret (for persistent tokens)
export FORTISTATE_SESSION_SECRET="your-secret-key"

# Audit log rotation
export FORTISTATE_AUDIT_MAX_SIZE=10485760  # 10MB in bytes
export FORTISTATE_AUDIT_ROTATE_DAYS=30     # 30 days
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "No authentication token" Error

**Problem:** Components can't connect to inspector

**Solution:**
1. Go to **Sessions** tab
2. Create a new session
3. Token is automatically saved to localStorage
4. Refresh the page if needed

### WebSocket Connection Failed

**Problem:** Presence viewer shows "Disconnected"

**Solution:**
1. Ensure inspector is running on `localhost:4000` (or your configured port)
2. If Presence keeps disconnecting, restart the inspector with `--allow-origin http://localhost:3000`
2. Check that you have a valid session token
3. Look for CORS issues in browser console
4. Try creating a new session

### Audit Log Access Denied

**Problem:** "Failed to fetch audit log: 403"

**Solution:**
1. Audit logs require **admin role**
2. Go to **Sessions** tab
3. Create a new session with role = "admin"
4. Return to **Audit** tab and try again

### Stores Not Updating

**Problem:** Changes don't appear in inspector

**Solution:**
1. Check inspector is running
2. Open browser console for errors
3. Verify stores are registered
4. Try refreshing both demo and inspector
