# Demo Stores Removal - Complete

## Overview
Removed all demo stores from the Fortistate Inspector to ensure a clean production state.

## Changes Made

### 1. Deleted Persisted Demo Stores
**File Removed:** `.fortistate-remote-stores.json`

This file contained 7 demo stores that were automatically loaded on inspector startup:
- ❌ `demoA` - Sample user data (Alice, score: 0)
- ❌ `demoB` - Sample user data (Bob, score: 7)
- ❌ `counter` - Simple counter (value: 0)
- ❌ `swapA` - Theme configuration sample
- ❌ `swapB` - Counter sample
- ❌ `movedTo` - Todo list sample
- ❌ `theme-sample` - Theme palette sample

**Status:** ✅ File deleted permanently

### 2. Updated .gitignore
Added `.fortistate-remote-stores.json` to `.gitignore` to prevent demo stores from being committed in the future.

**Before:**
```gitignore
node_modules/
dist/
*.tgz
.env
.DS_Store
.vscode/
coverage/
```

**After:**
```gitignore
node_modules/
dist/
*.tgz
.env
.DS_Store
.vscode/
coverage/
.fortistate-remote-stores.json
```

### 3. Updated Phone Register Demo
**File:** `examples/phone-register.html`

Made the phone registration tool more flexible and removed hardcoded demo values.

**Before:**
- Hardcoded store key: `'counter'`
- Hardcoded initial state: `{value: 0}`
- No user input for customization

**After:**
- ✅ User can specify custom store key (default: `'appState'`)
- ✅ User can provide custom initial state as JSON (default: `{}`)
- ✅ Input validation for JSON syntax
- ✅ Professional default values instead of demo names

### 4. Inspector Client Already Clean
**File:** `src/client/inspectorClient.ts`

Verified the inspector client has no hardcoded demo stores:
- ✅ No auto-created stores
- ✅ Smart store detection uses professional naming patterns: `['state', 'appState', 'store', 'main', 'root', 'app']`
- ✅ No demo keys like `'demoA'`, `'demoB'`, `'counter'`

## What Remains (Intentionally)

### Example/Demo Files (Should NOT be changed)
The following files in the `examples/` folder still contain demo stores **by design** - they're tutorials:

✅ **Kept (as intended):**
- `examples/telemetry-demo.mjs` - Demonstrates telemetry features
- `examples/universe-demo.mjs` - Shows physics universe creation
- `examples/physics/*.mjs` - Physics simulation examples
- `examples/game/multiplayer-demo.mjs` - Multiplayer game example
- `examples/presets/example-preset/` - Preset example

These are **documentation/tutorial files** and should have example stores.

## Verification

### Inspector State on Startup
```json
{}
```
The inspector now starts with **zero stores** - completely clean.

### User Workflow
1. User starts inspector → No demo stores present ✅
2. User can register stores via:
   - Phone register tool (with custom values)
   - `/register` API endpoint
   - Plugin/preset system
   - Application runtime registration

### Git Status
```bash
# Demo store persist file is now ignored
.fortistate-remote-stores.json → .gitignore
```

## Benefits

### Production Readiness
- ✅ No confusing demo data for new users
- ✅ Clean slate for real application development
- ✅ Professional first impression

### Developer Experience
- ✅ Clear separation: examples stay in `examples/`, inspector stays clean
- ✅ Phone register tool is now flexible and reusable
- ✅ No technical debt from hardcoded demos

### Testing & CI/CD
- ✅ Persist file won't be committed to version control
- ✅ Each test run starts fresh
- ✅ No accidental demo data in production builds

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Delete `.fortistate-remote-stores.json`
- [x] Add persist file to `.gitignore`
- [x] Update `phone-register.html` with flexible inputs
- [x] Verify inspector client has no demo keys
- [x] Confirm examples folder still has demo stores (as intended)

## Migration Guide

### For Users with Existing Demo Stores
If you had the old demo stores and want to start fresh:

1. **Stop the inspector**
2. **Delete the persist file:**
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item .fortistate-remote-stores.json
   ```
3. **Restart the inspector** - it will start with zero stores

### For Developers
- The inspector now requires explicit store registration
- Use the phone register tool or `/register` endpoint
- Or register stores via plugins/presets in your config

## Conclusion

The Fortistate Inspector is now **demo-free** and production-ready:

✅ **Deleted** 7 demo stores from persist file  
✅ **Protected** against future demo commits (.gitignore)  
✅ **Upgraded** phone register tool to be flexible  
✅ **Verified** inspector client uses professional naming  
✅ **Preserved** example/tutorial demos where appropriate  

The inspector now starts completely clean, providing a professional experience for real application development.
