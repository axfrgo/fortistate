# Next.js Demo App with Inspector Integration - Complete

## 🎉 Summary

Successfully remade the `examples/my-nextjs-app` demo to fully showcase the inspector's current features with a **Space Shooter Game** that demonstrates **ontogenetic law enforcement** in real-time.

## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. **Ontogenetic Laws System** (`src/stores/gameLaws.ts`)
Created 10 comprehensive game-specific laws:

- **GAME-001**: Player health bounds validation (0 to maxHealth)
- **GAME-002**: Score must be non-negative
- **GAME-003**: Level must be positive integer
- **GAME-004**: Resources should not exceed capacity
- **GAME-005**: Game pause time limit warnings
- **GAME-006**: Player position within game bounds
- **GAME-007**: High score tracking recommendations
- **GAME-008**: Enemy count synchronization
- **GAME-009**: Power-up expiration validation
- **GAME-010**: State mutation validation

Each law includes:
- Validation logic
- Severity levels (error, warning, info)
- Auto-fix implementations (where applicable)
- Suggestions for manual correction

### 2. **Space Shooter Game Component** (`src/components/SpaceShooterGame.tsx`)
Full-featured game with:

**Game Features:**
- Canvas-based 2D rendering (800x600 game board)
- Player spaceship with position, health, and speed
- Enemy spawning and management
- Resource system (energy, shields, ammo)
- Power-up system with expiration tracking
- Score and level progression
- High score tracking
- Pause/resume functionality

**Law Enforcement Integration:**
- Real-time validation against all 10 laws
- Visual violation panel with severity indicators
- Auto-fix button to repair all violations
- Categorized violations (errors, warnings, info)
- Suggestion display for each violation

**Law Violation Triggers:**
- 6 buttons to intentionally break specific laws
- Demonstrates inspector's detection and auto-fix
- Shows before/after state comparison

**Game Controls:**
- Movement (left, right, up, down)
- Shoot (consumes ammo)
- Spawn enemies
- Add score
- Level up
- Take damage
- Collect resources (ammo, shields)
- Activate power-ups

### 3. **Inspector Integration Utilities** (`src/utils/inspector.ts`)
Enhanced inspector utilities:

```typescript
- getInspectorToken() - Auto-detect token from localStorage/URL
- setInspectorToken(token) - Persist token
- getTargetStoreKey() - Get inspector's target store
- setTargetStoreKey(key) - Set target store
- openInspector() - Launch inspector in new tab
- checkInspectorConnection() - Verify inspector is running
- exposeStoresToInspector(keys) - Auto-expose stores for detection
- announceToInspector(appInfo) - Notify inspector of app
```

### 4. **Auto-Initialization** (`src/components/InspectorInit.tsx`)
Client component that:
- Automatically exposes all 7 stores to the inspector
- Announces the app to the inspector on mount
- Logs initialization status to console
- Requires zero manual configuration

### 5. **Updated Main Page** (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- Added new "🎮 Game Demo" navigation tab
- Highlighted the game in overview section
- Integrated SpaceShooterGame component
- Updated page title and metadata

### 6. **Comprehensive README** (`examples/my-nextjs-app/README.md`)
22KB documentation including:
- Quick start guide
- Inspector feature overview
- All 10 law descriptions
- Law preset explanations
- Workflow examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- Architecture diagrams
- Code examples for testing laws

### 7. **Store Configuration** (`src/stores/index.ts`)
- Added complete GameState TypeScript interface
- Documented all store schemas
- Ensures type safety throughout

## 🔍 Inspector Features Demonstrated

### Auto-Detection
The app automatically:
1. Exposes store keys on `window.__FORTISTATE_STORES__`
2. Announces itself to the inspector via `/announce` endpoint
3. Establishes WebSocket connection for real-time updates
4. Persists token and target key in localStorage

### Law Validation
The inspector can:
1. Monitor all stores for law violations
2. Display violations by severity (error/warning/info)
3. Show violation counts and details
4. Provide fix suggestions
5. Apply auto-fixes with one click

### Law Presets
Users can apply 5 pre-configured enforcement levels:
- **Strict** - All laws enforced (development mode)
- **Production** - Production-safe rules only
- **Development** - Balanced for active dev
- **Minimal** - Essential laws only
- **None** - Disable enforcement

### Timeline View
- Complete history of all state mutations
- Timestamp for each change
- Action/mutation type
- Before/after values
- Replay capability

### Telemetry
- Law violation metrics
- Most-failed laws tracking
- Performance data
- Real-time charts

## 🎮 How It Works

### Workflow

1. **User starts demo app** (`npm run dev` in examples/my-nextjs-app)
2. **InspectorInit runs** - Exposes stores, announces app
3. **User starts inspector** (`npm run inspect` from root)
4. **Inspector auto-detects** - Finds stores via WebSocket
5. **User navigates to Game Demo**
6. **Game initializes** with gameState store
7. **Laws validate on every state change**
8. **Violations appear in real-time** in inspector
9. **User can trigger violations** with demo buttons
10. **Inspector shows detailed violations** with suggestions
11. **User clicks Auto-Fix** - Violations repaired
12. **State corrects itself** - Game continues

### Technical Flow

```
User Action (e.g., "Break Health Law")
    ↓
useStore.gameState.set({ player: { health: 150 } })
    ↓
State mutation propagates via WebSocket
    ↓
Inspector receives updated state
    ↓
validateGameState('gameState', newState)
    ↓
Violations detected (GAME-001: health > maxHealth)
    ↓
Inspector UI shows violation in Laws panel
    ↓
User clicks "Auto-Fix"
    ↓
autoFixGameState() runs
    ↓
Fixed state: { player: { health: 100 } }
    ↓
useStore.gameState.set(fixedState)
    ↓
Game state corrected ✅
```

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Build Error
The Next.js app currently has a build error because fortistate's main export includes Node.js modules (`fs`) that can't be used in client components. 

**Solutions:**
1. Split `useStore` into a separate package entry without Node.js deps
2. Use dynamic imports for server-only code
3. Create client-specific build configuration

The **app runs fine in development mode** (`npm run dev`) but fails production build.

## 🔮 Next Steps

1. **Fix Build Issue** - Separate client/server exports
2. **Add More Games** - Tower defense, puzzle, etc.
3. **Custom Law Builder** - UI to create laws
4. **Law Marketplace** - Share law presets
5. **Multi-Player** - Sync game state across clients
6. **Persistence** - Save game progress to backend

## 📚 Documentation

All documentation is complete:
- ✅ README with quick start
- ✅ Inspector integration guide
